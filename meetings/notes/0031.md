# SIG-Testing meeting notes from 2022-11-15 @ 1900 UTC

* Moderator: Kadino
* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG Updates

* No major announcements.

## RFCs

### [Debuggability metrics](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/pull/54)

* doesn't address full problem, but is honest about this throughout the document
  * Title suggests it addresses full problem.
* build times are an issue (handled separately by SIG-Build)
* Let's move forward with the two steps recommended by this RFC (record failure-time metrics, poll users/SIGs)

### [Test Impact Framework](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/issues/53)

* Safe mode allows collecting data without skipping tests
  * Can build data, build confidence in using this to skip tests
* improvement to resource usage will help
  * can still blow out pole TODO
* Test deslection won't be perfect, but improving the average case may be worth impacting a small number of worst case debugging scenarios
* Worst case scenario TIAF ends up like the test batching feature, where SIGs later decide to offboard due to not having resources to stabilize their features
* SIG-Testing accepts this suggestion for an RFC.
  * This can move to a pull request that documents the RFC in the repo. Shouldn't need to be rewritten, and holding it open for additional comments is optional.

## Roundtable Discussion

### No additional topics

## Action Items

* @AMZN-scspaldi fix git DCO and merge pull request
* @jonawals open a pull request for the TIAF RFC
