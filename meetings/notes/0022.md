# SIG-Testing meeting notes from 2022-07-12 @ 1800 UTC

* Moderator: Kadino
* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG Updates

* There was a request for all SIGs to communicate their 2022 roadmap in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U_XAw9YJoPE3FlYeBKUz4kYjFRDS09NS3_YuZSZJ2qA/edit?usp=sharing). Before opening up for a roundtable discussion, let's discuss the next 5-6 months of committments and goals.
  * Only want to add larger critical deliverables, not every feature
  * Want dates only where confident about time committment
    * While there are a few engineers I frequently work with, Testing is one of the smaller SIGs: many contributors split their time between other SIGs, and we don't see much external contribution.
  * Does anyone see anything missing, or that needs clarification?
