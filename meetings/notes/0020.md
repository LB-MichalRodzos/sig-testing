* Moderator: Kadino
* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG Updates

* There's a proposed update to the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/9912) which makes a minor change in the code review experience
  * Being kept minimal and simple to encourage contribution
* [Intermittent RFC](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/issues/43) appears ready to move forward
  * Kadino to divide into issues to track implementation
  * Needs its metrics dependency met, which will be handled in an upcoming RFC

## Roundtable Discussion

### Recent AR Failures

* What are the types of failures?
  * Lack of root cause metrics means we don't have clear
* MultiplayerSample (networking) appears to be a contributor
* Have had valid failures caught post-submit
  * Change to cacheing caused secondary failures and had to be reverted
* Timings in Jenkins can be different than local
* Metrics on test execution times

### Editor Entity Utils circular import

* Around 2 weeks ago a new import was added for Prefab Utils, which imports EditorEntityUtils
  * Moved import to bottom of file, to work around this
* Can resolve by moving imports into classes
  * May be better to pull shared dependency into another module used by both
* Didn't see changes to this file go in, didn't have codeowners to notify
  * Added spam to logs, slowed down tests from extra actions
* Can we move these files to ownership by SIG-Testing?
  * Should files be pulled out into other files? (need to assess them)
    * HydraEditorUtils has seen a lot of organic growth, and likely should follow this route
    * Need to assess other utils

## Action Items

* Kadino - cut tasks for assessing new tools files and/or ownership for existing helper files
* Scott M - create ticket for resolving circular import
