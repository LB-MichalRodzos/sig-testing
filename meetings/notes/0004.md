## Test Metrics and Reporting
In our last meeting we discussed Metrics and Reporting to include from GHI. 

We now have a tool to scrape data from GHI and generate email metrics reports based on GHI filters. This will be used to generate weekly reports to the SIG leads regarding the issue metrics we want to track such as issues in needs-triage per SIG, open issues by priority, open issues by feature etc.

## Automated Review Nightly Run reporting
Currently the results of the AR Nightly runs are handled through a manual process of cutting bug tickets based off the reporting failures. The ownership of nightly failures should be handed off to the SIGs for long term scalability. 

* Potentially use tooling to auto-cut issues into GHI from nightly failures rather than making reports public
* There needs to be considerations for things such as de-duping issues for repeated failures
* RCA is very light on information and could make it difficult for a tool to de-dupe failures automatically
* With the GHI scraping tool we could run reports each day that give visibility to nightly failures that were auto-cut through tooling
* Potentially also use an auto-alert discord bot to message failures

The following issue was entered to perform further investigation into this https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/issues/10 

## Automated Testing Updates
Our current automation efforts include - 
* Extending and enabling Linux based automation
* Optimizations from parallelization of tests to reduce time and costs
* AR Reliability is focused on how we handle integration test failures
* AR Debugability to surface failures for all platforms into a single UI so that there is a one stop shop to show overall test failures for a single run rather than having to look into them as a single job
* Writing up best practices for authoring of automated tests into a public facing docs that can go out with the parallelization information

## Wrap up

There is additional work to help the other SIGs plan their tests, need to get SIG-Testing initiatives and issues populated, prioritized.

Currently plan regular SIG-Testing meetings every two weeks at this time, though impromptu meetings are encouraged.
