## SIG Updates

* Met with Technical Steering Committee (TSC) to discuss current challenges and goals
  * https://github.com/o3de/tsc/blob/main/meetings/notes/joint-meeting-20220329.md
  * No callouts from other SIGs, suggesting we are at least not blocking anything
* Discussed EditorPythonBindings with both SIG-Core and SIG-Content
  * Core considers these bindings to fall to SIG-Content.
  * No specific information on plans for these tools, but they are clearly relied on heavily.

## Roundtable Discussion

### Physics tests

Recently found an issue where EditorTest tests have a pattern of grouping its conditional tests. Multiple math calculations are combined into the same test, becomes hard to understand what is failing. Especially when floating point is involved.

Failure then results in investigating 10 different conditionals. No clue which is failing in the block since they are combined together, and only emit one "correct" signal. Especially difficult from Jenkins results.

Pattern is used throughout physics tests. May need some education on fixing this. Pull request could be a good way to demonstrate fixing this.
