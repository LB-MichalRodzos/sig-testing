# SIG-Testing meeting notes from 2022-04-19 @ 1800 UTC

* Moderator: Kadino
* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG Updates

* New RFC proposals should be arriving soon
* Looking for contributor support on delivering SIG-Testing's current RFCs, and better-defining proposed RFCs

## Reviewer Nomination

* Fuzzy nominates self: Approved!
* SIG-Testing currently does not differentiate between reviewer and maintainer
* Current contribution guide surprisingly points toward requesting all reviewer/maintainer status from SIG-Content.

## Roundtable Discussion

### AR instability

* Instability in Asset Processing led to a bypass mechanism being instituted for Automated Review of pull requests.
  * SIG-chairs have access, but can be slow to respond
* There's a number of failures related to file I/O, which have proven to be unreliable on rare occasions.
  * Reflection probe baking creates a file on the filesystem.
  * Recent failures in Physics
  * Recent fix to parallel modifications of JSON registry files
* Policy for handling instability remains insufficient for current contributors to follow.
  * Disabling tests also needs better notification.
    * GitHub CODEOWNERS may help notify

### Jenkins is Slow

* Jenkins UI is taking minutes to load! Being so slow reduces the ability to investigate failures, including test failures.
  * BlueOcean has a recent bug, which can partially be worked around, though the logs are indecipherably heavy without BlueOcean.

## Action Items

* Kadino: Open issue on SIG-Build for Jenkins UI slowness
* Kadino: Reach out to test owners about instability (Physics)
* Kadino: Add Fuzzy to maintainer
* Kadino: Investigate contribution guide wonkiness
* Scott M: RFC for EditorTest results consistency check
