* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG Updates

* Video sessions from O3DCon should soon be posted on the [O3DE youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Open3DEngine/videos)

## Roundtable Discussion

### Best Practices Outline

Working on a documentation page with testing advice. Should be out to review within the week, but interested in early feedback on the set of topics:

* Cheatsheet
  * Avoid
    * I/O
    * Sleep
    * Platform-specific Tests
    * Negative Assertions
  * Remember
    * Insanity Checks
    * Assertion Messages
    * Floating Point Assertions
    * Hard-coding Helps
* Sizes of Automated Tests in O3DE
  * Unit Tests
  * Integration Tests
  * System Tests
  * Acceptance Tests
* Other Automated Test Categories in O3DE
  * UI Tests
  * Performance/Load/Stress Tests
* Which Tests are Best?
* Where to write tests
* Test Names
* Disabling/Skipping Tests
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Plenty of more-specific advice hasn't made the cut, such as "Avoid conditional compilation for tests"

Utilities: they exist, how to contribute, how to deprecate. (see below)

### How do we find more SIG-Testing contributors?

Should we be reaching out to Royal, Finchy, and other partners?
* Creating discussion in external public groups
* Survey again for new meeting time.
* New SIG-Chair elections? Other SIGs did this.
* Reach out to other SIGs, to discuss what works for them
* Attend other SIG meetings, to see what works for them
* Blog posts?
* How can we schedule more outreach? Can we get more Producer / TPM support from Linux Foundation?

### Deprecating tools

Long-term plan for Hydra Test Tools and Editor Entity Utils? Deprecate the former.

* How to deprecate?
  * Announce as an impactful change
  * Mark deprecated to emit warnings
    * Identify owners and reach out directly
  * Remove (after at least 3 months)
    * Disable any broken tests which have not remove dependency

## RFCs

### (None ready to discuss - all are pending additional work)

## Action Items

* Kadino: Investigate existing deprecation docs, and request them if it does not exist.
* Fuzzy: Investigate MEE6 bot for meetings support, and discuss with Finchy.
