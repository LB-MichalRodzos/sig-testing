* Moderator: dk

## SIG Updates

* Kadino will be out on leave for the next few weeks and may be unavailable or delayed in any responses, dk will be handling a few of the action items around AR stability in his absence
* RFC from Scott M. is in https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/issues/37, there is no priority on this work set yet but the risk of this is lower priority than the difficulty and complexity of the problem we are solving; there is relation to https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/8874 that we should make sure we consider if/when we move forward with RFC before 8874.
* Looking for contributors support on delivering SID-Testing contribution and testing guides to build out more testing related resources. Any topic is open; creation and execution of manual and automated testing, guides for testing for specific areas of the editor, how to debug test failures, how to extend tests etc. 


## Reviewer Nomination

* No new Reviewer nominations


## Roundtable Discussion

### Switching Atom main test suite to EditorBatchedTest and splitting it 
https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/9323
Atom has parallel tests that are occasionally failing; this PR is to split the suite by limiting the number of batched tests to reduce likelihood of stability failures; increases runtime by ~100 seconds from 40-60 seconds to ~140 seconds; occurred about 1x a week and cost ~2hours of time to re-run the suite

evanchia is looking into addressing the stability issues via https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues/9167 once this is resolved we will look into re-batching the tests or running the batches parallel.

### First implementation of the Automation gem
evanchia brought up the Automation gem to get Testing SIG eyes on the work and general awareness.
https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/9163


## Action Items
* dk will put on agenda to add priority labels to GHI for next issue triage
* dk will create an issue where we can start to identify missing docs/guides from the website or testing SIG repo (ie; how to run tests locally; how to write tests)
* Testing SIG members to take a look at Automation Gem PR when they have time for general awareness and feedback
