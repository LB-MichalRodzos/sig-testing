# SIG-Testing meeting notes from 2023-02-07 @ 2200 UTC

* Moderator: Kadino
* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG Updates

* First meeting at the new meeting time
* New roadmap-issue workflow is now in use
  * Future work to help define Epic-level work as roadmap items, for SIG-Release / SIG-Docs-Community

## Roundtable Discussion

### Periodic Suite

* Multiple tests that have been failing for a long time, night after night
  * Please take look at any tests you are maintaining
* Beyond leaving this to other SIG's ownership, does SIG-Testing need to take action on this?
  * Can move to sandbox and notify owners with issues
* Planning to collect metrics, and have better notifications
  * Metrics are still a future-solution, doesn't help the problem today

### RFCs progress has been stagnant

* Winter holiday slowdown
  * This just happens, not something we can change
* Relatively few SIG-Testing contributors exist to drive issues
  * We should stay aware of this, and expect to operate as a small group
* New RFCs could have a focus group for defining the problem, to reduce the work of directly defining a solution
  * This is the intended purpose of RFCs, but this is unclear
  * Could be good to provide an example of an RFC first being proposed, then discussed in group, then to RFC
  * Focus first on problem and requirements, not the solution
  * Clarify our own issue templates
* Confusing issue templates for "RFC Suggestion request" and "RFC Feature request"
  * May not want 2 RFC templates
  * May want to clarify language
* Suggested workflow:
  1. RFC Issue created to define the problem
  2. SIG-Testing clarifies the problem in biweekly meeting
  3. RFC Issue gets a solution proposed in a `.md` file, as a Pull Request in https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/tree/main/rfcs
  4. Maintainers provide feedback asynchronously, with the intent to approve for merge

## RFCs

### Current RFCs are all pending work before review

## Action Items

* Scott M: Create an RFC for an improved RFC workflow
* Kadino: Mention RFC process in meeting template, to help us remember
