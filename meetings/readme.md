# O3DE Testing SIG - Meetings

## Meetings

Each SIG hosts a regular community meeting to update the community about the progress of O3DE and the SIG's contribution to the project. It is a recurring event to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard. The SIG holds primary meetings twice monthly, and often tracks [agendas on GitHub](https://github.com/o3de/foundation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Asig%2Ftesting+label%3Amtg-agenda+).

Please [reach out on Discord](https://discord.gg/p3padwr58u) or [Sign up on the Mailing Lists](https://lists.o3de.org/groups) to get notifications for the recurring events.

### I can't make the scheduled meeting!

The #sig-testing channel on [O3DE Discord](https://discord.gg/6cbrfZgyfg) is another great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [GitHub Discussions area](https://github.com/o3de/foundation/discussions) which need your input. Additionally, anyone in Discord is welcome to request scheduling an additional SIG meeting.

## Who can Attend

Anyone is welcome to attend! O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. *You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the project.*

## Agenda Items

The agenda for each meeting is saved as [an issue on Github](https://github.com/o3de/foundation/issues?q=label%3Asig%2Ftesting+label%3Amtg-agenda+) under the O3DE [Foundation repository](https://github.com/o3de/foundation).

Please feel free to propose any of your topics, thoughts, or areas you feel are important to discuss. *Agenda items do not need to all be pre-planned, and can be added during roundtable discussion portion of any meeting.*
